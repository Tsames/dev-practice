Top K Elements in List
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements within the array.
The test cases are generated such that the answer is always unique.
You may return the output in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3], k = 2
Output: [2,3]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [7,7], k = 1
Output: [7]

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10^4.
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
1 <= k <= number of distinct elements in nums.

        The idea here is that we could improve extracting the keys with the most frequent counts from our hashmap.
        We assemble a list of lists of length equal to nums + 1.
        Each index represents that number appeared the index number frequently (thats why we need the +1, because the 0th index would represent a number appearing 0 times).
        So for example, if 6 was in the nested list at index 2, then we know 6 appeared twice in nums.

        So first we iterate through nums, counting each numbers frequency with a hashmap.
        Next we iterate through the key, value pairs appending the number to the nested list at the index that represents its frequency.

        Finally, we iterate backwards through our list k number of times, filling our result list with each iteration.
        This is O(n + n + n) -> O(3n) -> O(n) time complexity.
