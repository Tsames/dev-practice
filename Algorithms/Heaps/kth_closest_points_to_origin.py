K Closest Points to Origin

You are given an 2-D array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinates of a point on an X-Y axis plane. You are also given an integer k.
Return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
The distance between two points is defined as the Euclidean distance (sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)).
You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: points = [[0,2],[2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[0,2]]
Explanation : The distance between (0, 2) and the origin (0, 0) is 2. The distance between (2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(2^2 + 2^2) = 2.82842. So the closest point to the origin is (0, 2).

Example 2:
Input: points = [[0,2],[2,0],[2,2]], k = 2
Output: [[0,2],[2,0]]
Explanation: The output [2,0],[0,2] would also be accepted.

Constraints:
1 <= k <= points.length <= 1000
-100 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 100
